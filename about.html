        <p>SkyGen was officially created in July of 2021, with the official release launching with the discord server in
            June
            2021, and has seen huge growth and updates since then. In Minecraft skygen is a game concept where players
            have
            'generators' of assorted blocks across Minecraft, a tycoon-like experience where players would try progress
            as much
            as they could across floating islands where anyone could be your enemy. SkyGen provides an experience that
            you just
            cant get other skygen server, which is how it became one of the most popular skygens of all time across
            Minecraft
            Bedrock!</p>

        <p>In mid 2022 SkyGen's creator Aribishere, would go on a hiatus eventually returning a couple of times
            throughout 2023.
            Ultimately Aribishere would quit SkyGen permanently on the 2nd of July 2023, in order to focus on more
            important
            things</p>

        <p>On the 23rd of August 2023, Aribishere would announce he is developing a game based on SkyGen, with a
            discount for
            veteran SkyGen players. As of lately the game is in semi-active development, no updates have been posted
            since then</p>
